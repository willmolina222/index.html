<h3><b>Final Project</b></h3>
<p> My product name is a website about Halo. 
    My team members are Hima, Kevin, Issac, and Rain.
    I will be using github, powershell, visual studio code html, and azure in order to show my Halo website.
    My proposal was updated 11/7/2021.
    My feature list will have my name, licenses, and my email address.
    My future feature is that I will use pictures from the web to detail my website.
    Basic feature will be the use of html in coding language.
   A advanced technical feature is that I will put a link to a website to try and buy the new Halo Infinite game.
